1. [React+Redux Password List](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/React-Redux-passwords-Tutorial) - This is an alternate take on the Todo List. The app keeps track of a list of user names and passwords, and generates random passwords. It uses React for views, Redux to manage application state, and persists data in local storage.
2. [React+Redux Timers App](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/React-Redux-Timers-Tutorial) - An advanced alternative to the Todo list. The app stores a list of timers, timers can be stoped and started.
